# Better Health Explorer
A new way for exploring health information.

This is the source code of my PhD project. This software prototype is to experiment with new ways for people to explore health information on the Internet. It needs Django 1.7 and Python 3.3+ to run.

Due to the busy life of a PhD student :) , I don't have time to clean up the code and write documentation for it. Needless to say this code is in a *messy* state (lots of parameters still point to the path of my local machine, for example). If you are interested in reading/understanding/running the code, please feel free to drop me an email (mail \_\_(at)\_\_ patrickpang.net) for details.
